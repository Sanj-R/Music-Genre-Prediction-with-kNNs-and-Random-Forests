#### ELEC 378 Final Project - Rice University - Spring 2023

Included are my contributions to the code and final report (which are precisely about my code) for my group's Spring 2023 ELEC 378 (Machine Learning: Concepts and Techniques) final project, in which we were tasked to train an ML model on 30-second-long song clips and genre labels to predict the music genres of new song clips.

**Notes:**
More details to be added soon. Training data and data source citation to be added soon.
